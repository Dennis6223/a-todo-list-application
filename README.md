# a-todo-list-application
this to do list application will allow users to create their day to  day activities that needs to be acomplished. i also want to add a scheduler, it will act as an alert system notifying them of their task completion or not done task. 
currently the application is simple. it only alloews the user to add task, update anbd delete the task. later i plan to integrate the scheduler
